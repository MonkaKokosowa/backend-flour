# Floury Backend
## ðŸš§ This project is still a heavy WIP ðŸš§

This is the backend of my website. It's mainly used for contact handling (basic SMTP) and in the future handling of blog posts and commenting on the website. 

### Usage
You can use this docker-compose to run it, or just build from source and run on bare metal
```
version: "3.8"

services:
  backend:
    image: ghcr.io/monkakokosowa/backend-flour:main
    container_name: backend-flour
    env_file: .env
    ports:
      - "4324:${PORT}"
    restart: unless-stopped
```
Remember to rename .env-example file and fill it with your own values!


### Issues
If you find any bugs, please don't abuse them but just make a bug report at [the issues tab](https://github.com/MonkaKokosowa/backend-flour/issues). 
There's not much to abuse anyways, it's just me here :p
