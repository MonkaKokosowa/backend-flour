# Floury Backend
## ðŸš§ This project is still a heavy WIP ðŸš§

This is the backend of my website. It's mainly used for contact handling (basic SMTP) and in the future handling of blog posts and commenting on the website. 

### Issues
If you find any bugs, please don't abuse them but just make a bug report at [the issues tab](https://github.com/MonkaKokosowa/backend-flour/issues). 
There's not much to abuse anyways, it's just me here :p
